# Predicting-Password-Strength-using-Supervised-ML-Techniques
To ensure vulnerabilities/weakness are not exploited, it is critical for companies to realize the risks that passwords face and to implement strong policies governing the generation and use of 
passwords. Classification based machine learning algorithms will help to classify the strength of passwords within predefined categories. 
Techniques like Decision tree classifier, Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayes Classifier, and Support Vector Machine can be used. The model with high accuracy 
can help to predict whether the password strength is strong or weak.

By implementing multiple machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), Multi-layer perceptron, and Support Vector Machine on a web 
application in real time, this provides a common and efficient way to defend against these online and offline attacks by forcing users to choose a strong 
password. This results in the user's account being logged into only if the password strength from all algorithms is strong.
